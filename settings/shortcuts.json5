/*
	This file defines the shortcuts usable on ZorroTracker. A single shortcut can have multiple aliases, or have none at all.
	This file is checked when the program runs (so, you can not edit it as the program is running), and will allow the shortcuts
	to be mapped to application functionality. If you use an invalid key or function name, the shortcut will be ignored,
	but the console will contain a message showing what happened. Please proceed with care.
