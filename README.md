## Using ZorroTracker
## Possible issues and solutions
### A JavaScript error occurred in the main process
If you get this error, its likely that you need to install [Visual C++](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads-2647da03-1eea-4433-9aff-95f26a218cc0). If that does not help, please contact the developers.

### `Chip is invalid` in the console or a log file
If you are building your own version of ZorroTracker from the source, this is likely incorrectly cloned submodules. See [cloning documentation](https://github.com/ZorroTrackerDev/ZorroTracker/tree/main/docs/building.md#cloning) for more information. Otherwise, please report to the developers!

### If the error is not listed here
Look through the issues page, or create your own, with __as much detail as possible__ to recreating the issue.
