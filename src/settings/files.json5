/*
	This file defines the links to other settings files the program will use to open/process your settings.
	You can choose to define multiple files for a single type as well. The last file will overwrite the previous files,
	in case of collisions (such as multiple preferences files, the last file will be the most important one!)
	Unless you know what you are doing, I recommend you not to mess with this file, as it can break the program.
